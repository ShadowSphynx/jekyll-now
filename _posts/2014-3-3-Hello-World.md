#My First Post

Well after waiting for a _long_ time to have my own website, here I am with one. Its more of a *blog* in its initial phase and i hope things would turn out to be good.

This website was made by [Jekyll and Github Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

That's enough fow now. Hope to write more. **_Saayo Naara!!_**

*P.S-* Here's a joke. Just like that...
